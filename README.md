The file `sourcing_t0+.ods` is something many peapople asked, it contains :
 - My inventory of parts to be printed (tab `Prints`)
 - The BOM I used for this build (tab `BOM`), included links if available
 - A pre-built wiring check (tab `Wiring`)
 - And a costs recap (tab `Costs`)

I'm from France, so prices are Euros â‚¬.
